    description: 'Mountain Pose (Tadasana) is the foundational standing pose from which all other standing poses emerge. Despite appearing simple, this pose teaches the fundamental principles of alignment, grounding, and body awareness that inform every aspect of yoga practice. The name comes from tada meaning mountain, reflecting the stable, grounded quality this pose embodies. Standing with feet together or hip-width apart, practitioners learn to distribute weight evenly, engage muscles appropriately, and find length through the spine. This deceptively challenging pose requires attention to subtle adjustments that create a sense of lift and ease. Regular practice of Tadasana improves posture, develops body awareness, and creates a template for optimal alignment.',

    description: 'Upward Salute (Urdhva Hastasana) extends Mountain Pose by reaching the arms overhead in a gesture of openness and aspiration. This fundamental pose appears in Sun Salutation sequences and serves as both a complete pose and a transition. The upward reach creates length through the entire body from feet to fingertips, stretching the shoulders, armpits, and belly. The pose embodies the quality of reaching upward with energy and intention while maintaining a grounded foundation through the feet. Upward Salute naturally encourages deeper breathing as the ribcage expands and the chest opens. The simplicity of the pose makes it accessible to all practitioners while offering opportunities for refinement through attention to alignment.',
