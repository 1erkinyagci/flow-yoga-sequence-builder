    short_description: 'A foundational hip-opening lunge with the back knee grounded.',
    description: 'Low Lunge (Anjaneyasana) is a fundamental standing pose that deeply stretches the hip flexors while building strength in the legs. Named after Anjani, mother of the Hindu deity Hanuman, this pose embodies grace and devotion. With the back knee resting on the ground, practitioners can focus on sinking the hips forward and down while maintaining an upright torso. This accessible lunge variation serves as an excellent preparation for deeper backbends and hip openers. The pose helps counteract the effects of prolonged sitting by releasing tension in the psoas and quadriceps. Regular practice improves hip mobility, enhances balance, and creates a sense of grounding and stability in the body.',

    description: 'Low Lunge Arms Overhead intensifies the traditional Low Lunge by adding an overhead arm extension that creates a complete stretch from fingertips to back toes. This variation opens the chest and shoulders while maintaining the deep hip flexor stretch of the base pose. Reaching the arms upward encourages length in the side body and engages the core for stability. The upward reach naturally lifts the heart and creates a subtle backbend through the upper spine. This pose is excellent for counteracting the forward-hunching posture common in daily life.

    description: 'Low Lunge with Back Leg Extended transforms the grounded lunge into a dynamic balance challenge by lifting and extending the back leg parallel to the floor. This variation significantly increases core engagement and tests stability while maintaining hip opening benefits. The extended back leg creates a beautiful line of energy from extended fingertips through pointed toes. This pose builds the strength and balance required for more advanced arm balances and standing poses. The challenge of maintaining alignment while balancing develops both physical strength and mental focus. Athletes appreciate this variation for its combination of flexibility work and functional strength training.',
