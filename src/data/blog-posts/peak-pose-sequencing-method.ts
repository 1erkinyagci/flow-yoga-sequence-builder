## Introduction {#introduction}

The **peak pose method** is the most logical approach to yoga sequencing. Instead of randomly stringing poses together, you work backwards from a destination—a challenging pose that everything else prepares for.

This method ensures:
- Every pose has a **purpose**
- The body is **properly prepared**
- Classes have a **clear arc**
- Students feel **accomplishment**

This guide will teach you how to analyze any peak pose, identify its requirements, and build a sequence that gets students there safely.

> **Build peak pose sequences easily**: [FLOW's sequence builder](/builder) helps you design flows with 420+ poses organized by preparation needs.

---

## What Is the Peak Pose Method? {#what-is-peak-pose}

### The Concept

**Peak pose sequencing** structures class like a story:

1. **Exposition** (Warm-up): Introduce the body to movement
2. **Rising Action** (Building poses): Progressively prepare for the peak
3. **Climax** (Peak pose): The challenging destination
4. **Falling Action** (Cool-down): Counter-poses and release
5. **Resolution** (Savasana): Integration and rest

### Why It Works

The peak pose method works because:
- **Anatomy is respected**: You don't ask cold muscles to do advanced work
- **Psychology is satisfied**: Students feel guided toward achievement
- **Safety is built-in**: Preparation prevents injury
- **Teaching is focused**: Every choice serves the goal

### Peak Pose vs. Theme-Based Sequencing

| Peak Pose Method | Theme-Based Method |
|------------------|-------------------|
| One pose as destination | Concept as organizing principle |
| Anatomically driven | Energetically or philosophically driven |
| Clear preparation logic | More flexible structure |
| Best for challenging poses | Best for gentler classes |

Both are valid—peak pose is ideal when targeting a specific challenging posture.

## Analyzing Your Peak Pose {#anatomy-analysis}

### The 5 Questions

Before sequencing, answer these questions about your peak pose:

**1. What joints are involved?**

Example—Wheel Pose: Shoulders (extension, external rotation), Spine (extension), Hips (extension), Wrists (extension)

**2. What muscles need to be open/flexible?**

Example—Wheel Pose: Chest/pectorals, Hip flexors, Quadriceps, Shoulders (front), Spine (front)

**3. What muscles need to be strong/active?**

Example—Wheel Pose: Glutes, Hamstrings, Back extensors, Triceps, Core (for support)

**4. What's the most challenging element?**

Example—Wheel Pose: For most students: Shoulder flexibility. Secondary: Hip flexor length

**5. What are common compensations?**

Example—Wheel Pose: Feet turn out (hip flexor tightness), Elbows splay (shoulder tightness), Lower back compression (glute weakness)

### Creating a Preparation List

From your analysis, create a **preparation list**:

**Wheel Pose Preparation List**:
- Open: Chest, shoulders, hip flexors, quads
- Strengthen: Glutes, back, arms
- Activate: Core
- Focus area: Shoulders

---

## Building the Sequence {#building-sequence}

### Phase 1: General Warm-Up (10-15 min)

Start with poses that:
- Warm the whole body
- Include spinal movement
- Increase circulation

**Universal warm-up elements**: Breath awareness, [Cat-Cow](/poses/cat-pose-marjaryasana) (spinal mobility), gentle twists, hip circles, Sun Salutations (optional)

### Phase 2: Targeted Preparation (15-25 min)

Now address your preparation list with specific poses:

**For Wheel Pose**:
| Need | Poses |
|------|-------|
| Open chest | Low Lunge with arms up, Humble Warrior |
| Open shoulders | Puppy Pose, Thread the Needle, Eagle arms |
| Open hip flexors | Low Lunge, Crescent Lunge, Warrior I |
| Open quads | Low Lunge with quad stretch, Hero Pose |
| Strengthen glutes | Bridge, Locust |
| Strengthen back | Cobra, Locust |

### Phase 3: Progressive Intensity (5-10 min)

Build toward the peak with related but easier poses:

**Wheel Progression**:
1. Bridge Pose (basic backbend)
2. Bridge with lifted heels
3. Supported Bridge with block
4. Wheel prep (just lifting onto head)

### Phase 4: Peak Pose (5-10 min)

**At the peak**:
- Clear setup instructions
- Multiple attempts (2-3)
- Modifications available
- Celebrate all levels of expression

**Timing**: Don't rush—students need time. But don't over-stay—muscles fatigue.

### Phase 5: Cool-Down (10-15 min)

After the peak:
- Immediate counter-pose
- Gentle releases
- Progressive calming
- Full Savasana

**After Wheel**:
1. Knees to Chest (immediate)
2. Supine Twist (gentle counter)
3. Happy Baby (hip release)
4. Savasana (integration)

## After the Peak {#after-the-peak}

### Immediate Counter-Pose

Right after the peak, include an **immediate release**:

| Peak Type | Immediate Counter |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Backbend | Knees to Chest, Child's Pose |
| Forward Fold | Gentle extension |
| Twist | Neutral spine, opposite twist |
| Arm balance | Wrist stretches, Child's Pose |
| Hip opener | Hip-neutral pose |

### Cool-Down Sequence

After the immediate counter:
1. 2-3 gentle floor poses
2. Supine twist (both sides)
3. Final release pose
4. Savasana (full length)

### Don't Skip Integration

The cool-down is where the body **integrates** the peak work. Rushing through it leaves the nervous system activated and feels incomplete to students.

---

## Common Peak Pose Errors {#common-errors}

### Error 1: Peak Too Early

**Problem**: Doing the hardest pose in the first half of class.
**Fix**: Peak should happen at 60-70% of class time.

### Error 2: Wrong Preparation

**Problem**: Preparing body parts that aren't needed for the peak.
**Fix**: Analyze the peak pose first, then build preparation list.

### Error 3: Insufficient Build

**Problem**: One or two prep poses, then immediately to peak.
**Fix**: Include 4-6 poses that progressively approach the peak.

### Error 4: No Regression

**Problem**: Only teaching full expression of peak pose.
**Fix**: Offer 2-3 levels: prep, partial, and full expression.

### Error 5: Forgetting Counter-Poses

**Problem**: Peak pose → Savasana with nothing between.
**Fix**: Always include counter-pose and cool-down.

## Frequently Asked Questions {#faq}
`,
  faqs: [
    {
      question: "What is the peak pose method in yoga?",
      answer: "The peak pose method is a sequencing approach where you choose one challenging pose as the 'destination' of your class, then build every other pose to prepare for it. The class structure mirrors a story arc: warm-up (exposition), building poses (rising action), peak pose (climax), cool-down (falling action), and Savasana (resolution)."
    },
    {
      question: "How do I choose a peak pose for my yoga class?",
      answer: "Consider: student level (beginners need accessible peaks like Warrior II; advanced students can work toward arm balances), class theme (hip opening → Pigeon; strength → Crow), time of day (energizing peaks for morning; gentler for evening), and what you've been building toward in recent classes."
    },
    {
      question: "When should the peak pose happen in a yoga class?",
      answer: "The peak pose should occur around 60-70% through the class. In a 60-minute class, that's around the 35-45 minute mark. This allows sufficient warm-up and preparation before, and adequate cool-down and Savasana after."
    },
    {
      question: "What makes a good peak pose for beginners?",
      answer: "Good beginner peak poses are challenging but accessible: Warrior II (strength and alignment), Tree Pose (balance), Triangle (multiple elements), Bridge Pose (backbend), and Pigeon (hip opening). These poses feel like accomplishments without requiring advanced flexibility or strength."
    },
    {
      question: "How many preparation poses do I need before a peak pose?",
      answer: "Generally, include 4-8 poses that specifically prepare for your peak, plus general warm-up. More complex peaks need more preparation. For Wheel Pose, you might need 6-8 specific prep poses; for Triangle, 3-4 might suffice. Quality matters more than quantity."
    },
    {
      question: "What should come after the peak pose in yoga?",
      answer: "After the peak: immediate counter-pose (Knees to Chest after backbends), 2-3 gentle floor poses, supine twist, and full Savasana. This cool-down allows the body to integrate the peak work and the nervous system to calm."
    },
    {
      question: "Can a yoga class have multiple peak poses?",
      answer: "A single peak is usually most effective—it gives clear focus. However, you can have a 'primary peak' and a 'secondary peak' if they require similar preparation (e.g., Wheel and Camel both need similar prep). Avoid multiple peaks that need completely different preparation."
    },
    {
      question: "How do I modify peak poses for different levels?",
      answer: "Offer 2-3 levels: preparation version (e.g., Crow with toes on floor), partial expression (e.g., one foot lifted in Crow), and full pose. Describe all options positively and let students choose. Everyone should feel successful at their level."
