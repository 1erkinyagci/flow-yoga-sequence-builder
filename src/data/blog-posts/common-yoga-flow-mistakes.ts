## Introduction {#introduction}

Every yoga teacher makes sequencing mistakes—especially when starting out. The good news? Most mistakes are predictable and preventable once you know what to watch for.

This guide covers the **12 most common yoga flow mistakes** and exactly how to fix them. Avoid these errors, and you'll create safer, more effective, and more enjoyable classes.

> **Build better sequences**: [FLOW's sequence builder](/builder) includes built-in warnings for common sequencing issues.

---

## Warm-Up Mistakes {#warmup-mistakes}

### Mistake #1: Skipping or Rushing the Warm-Up

**The problem**: Jumping into challenging poses before the body is ready.

**Why it happens**: Teachers feel pressure to "get to the good stuff" or run out of time.

**The risk**: Increased injury risk, students feel unprepared, tight muscles limit pose depth.

**The fix**:
- Dedicate **15-20% of class** to warm-up (10-12 min in a 60-min class)
- Always include spinal movement ([Cat-Cow](/poses/cat-pose-marjaryasana))
- Progress from gentle to active
- Never start with deep stretches or demanding poses

**Rule**: If students' muscles aren't warm, the pose won't be safe.

### Mistake #2: Wrong Warm-Up for the Sequence

**The problem**: Warming up the wrong body parts for what comes later.

**Example**: Doing only hip circles, then asking for deep shoulder work.

**The fix**: Match warm-up to peak pose requirements:

| Peak Pose | Warm-Up Should Include |
|-----------|----------------------|
| Backbends | Shoulder openers, hip flexor stretches, gentle extensions |
| Hip openers | Hip circles, low lunges, gentle standing poses |
| Arm balances | Wrist prep, plank holds, core activation |
| Forward folds | Hamstring stretches, spinal movement |

---

## Sequencing Mistakes {#sequencing-mistakes}

### Mistake #3: No Peak Pose or Focus

**The problem**: A random collection of poses without direction.

**Why it matters**: Students feel the class has no purpose; there's no sense of accomplishment.

**The fix**:
- Choose ONE peak pose or theme per class
- Build every pose toward that peak
- Ask: "Does this pose help prepare for the peak?"

### Mistake #4: Missing Counter-Poses

**The problem**: Intense work in one direction without balancing the opposite.

**Examples of missing counter-poses**:
- Deep backbend → immediately into forward fold (needs gentle transition)
- Extended right-side twist → no left-side twist
- Lots of flexion → no extension

**The fix**: After every intense pose, include its opposite:

| Action | Counter-Pose Needed |
|--------|-------------------|
| Backbend | Gentle forward fold or Child's Pose |
| Forward fold | Gentle extension |
| Right twist | Left twist |
| Hip opening | Hip stabilizing |

### Mistake #5: Forgetting Bilateral Symmetry

**The problem**: Doing poses on one side and forgetting the other.

**Why it happens**: Getting lost in teaching, time pressure, distraction.

**The fix**:
- Use a sequence builder like [FLOW](/builder) that tracks sides
- Teach right and left together before moving on
- Verbal reminder: "That was right side—now left"

### Mistake #6: Too Many Poses

**The problem**: Cramming 40 poses into 60 minutes.

**Why it matters**: Students feel rushed, can't experience poses, transitions become chaotic.

**The fix**:
- **60-minute class**: 18-25 poses maximum
- **30-minute class**: 10-15 poses
- Quality over quantity—always

**Better approach**: Fewer poses, held longer, with clear instruction.

### Mistake #7: Illogical Transitions

**The problem**: Constant position changes that disrupt flow.

**Example of bad sequencing**:
1. Standing Forward Fold
2. Seated Twist (down to floor)
3. Warrior II (back up)
4. Reclined Twist (back down)
5. Tree Pose (back up)

**The fix**: Group poses by position:
1. Complete all standing work
2. Transition to floor once
3. Complete all floor work

---

## Pacing Mistakes {#pacing-mistakes}

### Mistake #8: Same Pace Throughout

**The problem**: Teaching at one speed from start to finish.

**Why it matters**: No energy arc, students don't experience rhythm, class feels flat.

**The fix**: Create an energy wave:

| Phase | Energy | Pacing |
|-------|--------|--------|
| Opening | Low | Slow, spacious |
| Warm-up | Building | Gradually increasing |
| Standing | Peak | Active, flowing |
| Peak pose | Highest | Challenging, focused |
| Floor | Declining | Slowing down |
| Savasana | Lowest | Stillness |

### Mistake #9: Moving Too Fast

**The problem**: Racing through poses without time to experience them.

**Signs you're moving too fast**:
- Students seem confused
- People are always a pose behind
- No time for alignment cues
- You finish early

**The fix**:
- Hold poses for minimum 3-5 breaths
- Pause between cues
- Watch students, not your plan
- When in doubt, slow down

### Mistake #10: Hold Times Don't Match Style

**The problem**: Holding poses for wrong duration for the class type.

| Style | Expected Hold | Mistake |
|-------|---------------|---------|
| Vinyasa | 3-5 breaths | Holding for 30 seconds |
| Hatha | 5-10 breaths | Moving every 2 breaths |
| Yin | 3-5 minutes | Holding for 1 minute |
| Restorative | 5-15 minutes | Rushing after 3 minutes |

**The fix**: Match hold times to style and student expectations.

## Safety Mistakes {#safety-mistakes}

### Mistake #11: No Modifications Offered

**The problem**: Teaching as if everyone can do every pose fully.

**The risk**: Students push beyond their limits, injuries occur, people feel excluded.

**The fix**:
- Offer modifications **before** students struggle
- Say "try this OR this" rather than "if you can't..."
- Know 2-3 modifications for every challenging pose
- Make props accessible and normalized

**Language matters**:
- Don't say: "If you can't do this..."
- Say: "You might prefer this option..."

### Mistake #12: Ignoring Contraindications

**The problem**: Not knowing which poses are risky for which conditions.

**Common contraindication failures**:
- Inversions for people with high blood pressure
- Deep twists for pregnant students
- Intense backbends for back pain students
- Wrist loading for carpal tunnel

**The fix**:
- Learn contraindications for challenging poses
- Ask about injuries before class
- Use [FLOW's pose library](/poses) which includes contraindications
- When in doubt, offer an alternative

## Closing Mistakes {#closing-mistakes}

### Mistake #13: Skipping or Shortening Savasana

**The problem**: Running out of time and cutting Savasana short.

**Why this is serious**:
- Savasana is where integration happens
- Students feel cheated
- Nervous system doesn't calm
- Class feels incomplete

**Minimum Savasana times**:
- 30-minute class: 3-4 minutes
- 60-minute class: 5-7 minutes
- 75-minute class: 7-10 minutes
- 90-minute class: 10-15 minutes

**The fix**: Plan backwards from Savasana. Decide your end time and work backwards.

### Mistake #14: Jarring Ending

**The problem**: Abruptly ending without transition from active to rest.

**Example**: "Okay, one more Warrior II... and Savasana!"

**The fix**: Create a **cool-down bridge**:
1. Final standing pose
2. Transition to floor
3. Gentle floor stretches (2-3 poses)
4. Supine twist
5. Knees to chest
6. Savasana

## Frequently Asked Questions {#faq}
`,
  faqs: [
    {
      question: "What's the most common yoga sequencing mistake?",
      answer: "Skipping or rushing the warm-up is the most common and most problematic mistake. Without proper warm-up, injury risk increases and students can't access poses fully. Always dedicate 15-20% of class time to warming the body—even if it feels like 'wasted time.'"
    },
    {
      question: "How do I know if my yoga sequence has too many poses?",
      answer: "Signs of too many poses: students seem rushed, there's no time for alignment cues, you're always running behind, and transitions feel chaotic. Aim for 18-25 poses in a 60-minute class. If you have more, ask which poses are truly necessary for your theme."
    },
    {
      question: "What happens if I skip counter-poses in yoga?",
      answer: "Skipping counter-poses can lead to muscle imbalances, discomfort, and incomplete energy release. For example, deep backbends without gentle forward folds afterward leave the spine compressed. Always balance intense work with its opposite before moving on."
    },
    {
      question: "How long should Savasana really be?",
      answer: "Minimum 5-7 minutes for a 60-minute class, and longer for longer classes. Savasana is where the nervous system integrates the practice—shortening it cheats students of a key benefit. Plan your class backwards from a full Savasana."
    },
    {
      question: "Why do my yoga classes feel rushed?",
      answer: "Common causes: too many poses, moving too quickly between poses, inadequate planning, and not watching the clock. Fix by reducing pose count, holding each pose longer, and timing your sequence in advance. When in doubt, cut poses and slow down."
    },
    {
      question: "How can I remember to teach both sides in yoga?",
      answer: "Use a sequence builder that tracks bilateral poses, verbally remind yourself ('that was right, now left'), or physically cue yourself (touch your left hip when moving to left side). Practice your sequence beforehand to catch any missed sides."
    },
    {
      question: "What modifications should every yoga teacher know?",
      answer: "Essential modifications: bent knees in forward folds, blocks in Triangle and Half Moon, wall for balance poses, reclined variations for seated poses, and knees-down for planks. Know at least two modifications for every challenging pose in your sequence."
    },
    {
      question: "How do I fix choppy transitions in my yoga flow?",
      answer: "Group poses by position: complete all standing work before transitioning to floor. Avoid bouncing between standing and floor repeatedly. Plan transitions in advance and practice them. Use linking poses (Downward Dog, Tabletop) to smooth position changes."
