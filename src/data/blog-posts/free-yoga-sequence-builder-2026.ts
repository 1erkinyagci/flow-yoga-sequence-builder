## Introduction {#introduction}

As a yoga teacher, you know that **creating effective, safe yoga sequences** is one of the most time-consuming parts of class preparation. Whether you're a newly certified instructor or a seasoned teacher with years of experience, you need tools that help you plan professional classes quickly.

But here's the challenge: most yoga sequencing platforms charge **$10-30 per month**, which adds up quickly—especially when you're just starting your teaching career or running a small studio on a tight budget.

That's why we built **[FLOW Yoga Sequence Builder](/)**: a completely free yoga sequence builder that gives you access to professional-grade tools without any cost.

In this comprehensive guide, you'll learn:
- Why FLOW is the **best free yoga sequence builder in 2026**
- What features you get at no cost
- How to create your first professional yoga sequence
- How FLOW compares to paid alternatives

## Why a Free Yoga Sequence Builder Matters {#why-free-matters}

### The Real Cost of Yoga Teaching

Let's be honest about the economics of yoga teaching:

- Average yoga teacher income: **$30,000-50,000/year**
- Yoga Alliance registration: **$65-115/year**
- Liability insurance: **$150-300/year**
- Continuing education: **$200-500/year**
- Marketing and website: **$100-500/year**

When you add a **$15/month sequencing subscription** ($180/year), it's yet another expense eating into your income.

### What Yoga Teachers Actually Need

Based on feedback from thousands of yoga teachers, here's what you actually need from a sequence builder:

1. **Comprehensive pose library** with correct alignment cues
2. **Easy-to-use interface** that doesn't require training
3. **Sanskrit names** and pronunciations
4. **Modifications** for different skill levels
5. **Contraindications** for student safety
6. **Save and organize** sequences by class type

**FLOW provides all of this—for free.**

## What is FLOW Yoga Sequence Builder? {#what-is-flow}

## Frequently Asked Questions {#faq}
`,
  faqs: [
    {
      question: "Is FLOW Yoga Sequence Builder really free?",
      answer: "Yes! FLOW offers a genuinely free tier that includes full access to our 365+ pose library, the drag-and-drop sequence builder, and 3 AI suggestions per day.

    },
    {
      question: "What's the difference between FLOW free and FLOW Pro?",
      answer: "FLOW free includes full pose library access (365+ poses), sequence builder (3 flows, 8 poses each), and 3 AI suggestions per day. FLOW Pro ($4.99/month) adds unlimited flows, unlimited poses per flow, PDF export, shareable links, unlimited AI suggestions, and priority support."
    },
    {
      question: "Do I need to create an account to use FLOW?",
      answer: "You can start using the sequence builder immediately without an account. To save your sequences permanently, you'll need to create a free account (just email and password). Your sequences sync across devices once you're logged in."
    },
    {
      question: "How many poses does FLOW's free library include?",
      answer: "FLOW's free tier includes access to all 365+ poses in our library—the same poses available to Pro users. Each pose includes English and Sanskrit names, step-by-step instructions, alignment cues, benefits, contraindications, modifications, and variations."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I print sequences from the free version?",
      answer: "PDF export is a Pro feature. However, you can use your browser's print function to print the sequence view directly, or take screenshots for personal reference. For professional-quality printable handouts, consider upgrading to Pro."
    },
    {
      question: "How does FLOW compare to Tummee?",
      answer: "FLOW offers a more generous free tier (365+ full-access poses vs Tummee's limited free selection), more detailed pose information, and a modern interface. Tummee has a larger total pose library (1000+) but charges for full access. FLOW is better for teachers who want quality over quantity."
    },
    {
      question: "Is FLOW better than using YouTube for sequence planning?",
      answer: "While YouTube is great for inspiration, FLOW provides tools YouTube can't: searchable pose database, drag-and-drop sequencing, timing controls, contraindications for safety, and saved sequences you can modify. Most teachers use both—YouTube for ideas, FLOW for creating their unique sequences."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I use FLOW on my phone or tablet?",
      answer: "Yes! FLOW is fully responsive and works on any device with a web browser. The interface adapts to your screen size, making it easy to plan sequences on desktop and reference them on mobile during class."

    {
      question: "Does FLOW work offline?",
      answer: "FLOW requires an internet connection to access the pose library and save sequences. However, you can export sequences (Pro) or screenshot them for offline reference during class."
    },
    {
      question: "How long does it take to create a sequence in FLOW?",
      answer: "Most teachers create a complete 60-minute sequence in 10-15 minutes once familiar with the interface. Your first sequence might take 20-30 minutes as you explore the pose library. Compare this to 45-60 minutes of manual planning."
    },
    {
      question: "Is the pose information in FLOW accurate?",
      answer: "Yes. All pose information is written and reviewed by certified yoga instructors with extensive teaching experience. We include alignment cues based on established yoga traditions and note contraindications for student safety. Poses are regularly updated based on teacher feedback."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I share sequences with other teachers?",
      answer: "Shareable links are a Pro feature. On the free tier, you can export pose lists manually or invite other teachers to create their own free accounts. Pro users can share direct links that let others view (but not edit) their sequences."
    },
    {
      question: "What yoga styles does FLOW support?",
      answer: "FLOW supports all major yoga styles including Vinyasa, Hatha, Yin, Restorative, Power, Ashtanga, and more. The pose library includes poses appropriate for each style, and you can tag sequences by style for easy organization."
    },
    {
      question: "How do I find poses for specific body parts?",
      answer: "Use the filter options in the Pose Library to sort by primary focus area (hips, hamstrings, shoulders, core, etc.) or use the search function to find poses targeting specific body parts. Each pose also lists its primary and secondary focus areas."
    },
    {
      question: "Does FLOW include Sanskrit names?",
      answer: "Yes! Every pose in FLOW includes both the English name and Sanskrit name with pronunciation guide. This helps teachers accurately call poses in either language and educate students about traditional yoga terminology."
    },
    {
      question: "What if I need a pose that's not in FLOW?",
      answer: "With 365+ poses, FLOW covers most common yoga poses. If you need a specific pose that's not included, contact our team—we regularly add new poses based on teacher requests. You can also add custom notes to similar poses as a workaround."
    },
    {
      question: "Is FLOW safe to use for my yoga business?",
      answer: "Absolutely. FLOW is designed for professional yoga teachers. The pose information includes contraindications to help you teach safely. However, always apply your own training and judgment when teaching—no software replaces proper yoga education."
    },
    {
      question: "How do I get help if I have questions?",
      answer: "Free users can access our help documentation and community resources. Pro users receive priority email support. We also have an active community of yoga teachers who help each other with sequencing questions."
    },
    {
      question: "Will FLOW always have a free tier?",
      answer: "Yes. Our mission is to make quality yoga teaching tools accessible to all teachers. The free tier is a permanent part of FLOW, not a promotional offer. We fund development through Pro subscriptions from teachers who want additional features."
